# Product Context: ClipForge

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Video is the dominant content format in 2025. Every creator, educator, and professional needs video editing tools, but existing solutions have barriers:

- **Complexity**: Professional tools like Premiere Pro require extensive learning
- **Cost**: Subscription models create barriers for individual creators
- **Platform limitations**: Mobile editors lack desktop power and precision
- **Workflow gaps**: No seamless integration between recording and editing

### The Opportunity
CapCut transformed video editing by making it accessible and intuitive. What used to require complex desktop software and hours of learning could now be done in minutes on your phone or computer. The secret? A streamlined interface focused on the essentials: trim, splice, add effects, export.

**Now imagine building that experience from scratch for the desktop.** A native application where creators can record their screen, import clips, arrange them on a timeline, and export professional-looking videos â€” all without leaving the app.
