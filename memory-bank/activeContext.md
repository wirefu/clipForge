# Active Context: ClipForge Current Work

## Current Session Focus
**Memory Bank Setup and Project Initialization**

This session is focused on establishing the Memory Bank system for ClipForge, a desktop video editor being built in a 72-hour sprint. The goal is to create comprehensive documentation that will persist across AI sessions and provide complete project context.

## Recent Changes
- **Memory Bank Creation**: Established `memory-bank/` directory structure
- **Core Documentation**: Created foundational Memory Bank files:
  - `projectbrief.md`: Project overview, deadlines, and requirements
  - `productContext.md`: User needs, market positioning, and success metrics
  - `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture patterns and design principles
  - `techContext.md`: Technology stack and development environment
- **Directory Structure**: Set up `.cursor/rules/` for project intelligence

## Current State Analysis

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Electron Multi-Process**: Main process for system operations, renderer for UI
2. **Redux Toolkit**: Centralized state management with slices
3. **TypeScript**: Strict mode for type safety
4. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling approach
5. **Vite**: Fast development and optimized builds

### Pending Decisions
1. **FFmpeg Integration**: How to bundle FFmpeg (system vs bundled)
2. **Recording Implementation**: DesktopCapturer vs getUserMedia approach
3. **Export Quality**: Default quality settings and presets
4. **Error Handling**: Global error boundary strategy
5. **Performance**: Virtual rendering implementation details

### Technical Considerations
- **Memory Management**: Large video files require efficient handling
- **Performance**: Timeline UI must remain responsive with many clips
- **Security**: Electron security best practices implementation
- **Packaging**: macOS code signing and notarization requirements

## Current Challenges

### Time Constraints
- **72-hour limit**: Extremely compressed timeline
- **Feature scope**: Must prioritize MVP requirements
- **Quality vs Speed**: Balance between functionality and polish
- **Testing time**: Limited time for comprehensive testing

### Technical Challenges
- **FFmpeg Integration**: Complex video processing pipeline
- **Recording Implementation**: Cross-platform screen/webcam recording
- **Timeline Performance**: Smooth UI with many clips
- **Export Pipeline**: Reliable video export with progress tracking

### Resource Constraints
- **Single Developer**: No team collaboration
- **Limited Testing**: Cannot test on multiple platforms
- **Documentation**: Must balance documentation with development time
- **Polish**: Limited time for UI/UX refinement

## Development Priorities

### Phase 1: MVP (Days 1-2)
1. **Core Functionality**: Import, timeline, preview, export
2. **Basic UI**: Functional but not polished
3. **Essential Features**: Only MVP requirements
4. **Testing**: Basic smoke tests only

### Phase 2: Full Submission (Day 3)
1. **Recording Features**: Screen and webcam recording
2. **Enhanced Timeline**: Multi-track, advanced editing
3. **Export Options**: Multiple formats and quality settings
4. **Polish**: UI improvements and bug fixes

### Stretch Goals (If Time Permits)
1. **Text Overlays**: Basic text addition
2. **Transitions**: Simple crossfades
3. **Audio Controls**: Volume and fade controls
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power user features

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **FFmpeg Issues**: Test export early and often
- **Recording Problems**: Implement fallback methods
- **Performance Issues**: Profile and optimize continuously
- **Build Failures**: Test packaging early

### Timeline Risks
- **Feature Creep**: Stick to MVP requirements
- **Over-engineering**: Keep solutions simple
- **Testing Overhead**: Focus on critical path testing
- **Documentation Burden**: Balance with development time
