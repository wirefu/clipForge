# Progress: ClipForge Development Status

## Overall Progress
**Status**: Core features implemented, EPIPE error during refresh persists  
**Phase**: Phase 2 - Full Submission Features  
**Timeline**: Advanced development phase  
**Completion**: ~75% (Core MVP + Advanced Timeline + Recording + Preview + Export)

## Current Known Issues

### 🔴 EPIPE Error During App Refresh (PERSISTENT)
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Ongoing issue despite multiple fixes

**Description**: EPIPE (broken pipe) error occurs when refreshing the Electron app. Error originates from console methods or child process streams (FFmpeg) writing to closed pipes.

**Attempted Fixes**:
1. ✅ Wrapped console methods to catch EPIPE errors
2. ✅ Added IPC sender validation before sending messages
3. ✅ Added interval cleanup when renderer is destroyed
4. ✅ Added global uncaught exception handlers
5. ❌ **Issue persists** - likely from FFmpeg child process streams

**Root Cause**: Child processes (FFmpeg) may still be writing to stdout/stderr streams when the renderer refreshes, causing EPIPE errors when trying to write to closed pipes.

**Next Steps**: 
- Add error handlers to child process streams (stdout/stderr)
- Cleanup/kill child processes on renderer destroy
- Consider using stream error handlers for FFmpeg processes

## What Works (Completed)

### ✅ Project Setup and Configuration
- **Package.json**: All dependencies configured correctly
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, proper configuration
- **Vite**: Development server and build system configured
- **Electron**: Complete Electron setup with IPC handlers
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling framework integrated
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management fully integrated
- **Testing**: Vitest and Playwright configured
- **Linting**: ESLint and Prettier configured
- **Git**: Repository with proper branching and commits

### ✅ Recording Features (Fully Implemented)
- **Screen Recording**: FFmpeg-based screen recording via avfoundation
- **Webcam Recording**: MediaRecorder API in renderer process (architectural fix for resource contention)
- **Recording Controls**: Start/stop, pause/resume, duration timer, quality settings
- **Device Management**: Camera and microphone device selection
- **Recording Status**: Synchronized between main and renderer processes
- **File Output**: Recordings saved via Electron file system API

**Key Implementation Notes**:
- Webcam recording uses pure browser approach (MediaRecorder) to avoid FFmpeg resource contention
- Screen recording uses FFmpeg with proper parameter handling
- IPC handlers prevent duplicate registration during hot reloads
- Timer cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Recent Fixes**: File saving uses Electron API, pause/resume implemented, stop handler waits for save completion

### ✅ Import & Media Management (Fully Implemented)
- **Drag & Drop**: Video/audio/image file import with visual feedback
- **File Picker**: Electron dialog integration for file selection
- **File Validation**: MP4/MOV/WebM format validation
- **Metadata Extraction**: FFprobe integration for accurate metadata (duration, resolution, codecs, fps, bitrate)
- **Thumbnail Generation**: FFmpeg-based thumbnail creation
- **Media Library**: Grid display with thumbnails and metadata
- **Media Items**: Individual media item components with selection
- **Delete Functionality**: Remove files from library

**Key Implementation Notes**:
- Metadata extraction uses ffprobe for real-time data instead of placeholders
- Single ffprobe call per file for efficiency
- Proper error handling and fallback metadata

### ✅ Timeline Editor (Fully Implemented)
- **Multi-clip Timeline**: Visual timeline with multiple tracks and clips
- **Clip Manipulation**: Drag clips horizontally, trim start/end, split at playhead
- **Time Ruler**: Dynamic time markers based on total duration
- **Playhead**: Draggable playhead with snapping (grid and clip edges)
- **Zoom Controls**: Zoom in/out (10-500 pixels per second)
- **Snap to Grid**: Grid snapping with configurable grid size
- **Track Controls**: Mute (M) and Solo (S) buttons for tracks
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Delete (Del), Split (S), Zoom (+/-)
- **Event Handling**: Proper event propagation handling (M/S buttons don't move playhead)

**Key Implementation Notes**:
- Completely rebuilt from scratch to meet requirements
- Time calculations use seconds internally, converted to pixels for display
- Snap to grid always snaps when enabled (no threshold)
- Clip edge snapping only when grid snapping is disabled
- Proper state management with Redux

### ✅ Timeline Preview (Fully Implemented)
- **Real-time Preview**: Shows timeline composition with all clips
- **Multi-clip Playback**: Automatically switches between clips during playback
- **Play/Pause Controls**: Toolbar controls and keyboard shortcuts (Space bar)
- **Scrubbing**: Dragging playhead seeks video to correct position
- **Audio Synchronization**: Audio and video synchronized during playback
- **Frame-accurate Preview**: Shows current frame at playhead position when paused

**Key Implementation Notes**:
- TimelinePreview component handles multi-clip composition
- Automatic clip transitions during playback
- Proper seeking and time synchronization

### ⚠️ Export Features (Partially Implemented)
- **Export to MP4**: FFmpeg-based export functionality ✅
- **Progress Indicator**: Percentage, time, speed, ETA display ✅
- **Save to Local File System**: File dialog for output selection ✅
- **Resolution Options**: 720p and 1080p presets exist ⚠️
  - ⚠️ **Missing**: "Source resolution" option/button
  - Current implementation hardcodes 1920x1080 even though MediaFile has metadata.width/height
- **Cloud Storage**: Not implemented ❌

**Key Implementation Notes**:
- Export uses FFmpeg service with progress tracking
- Settings include resolution, quality, format options
- Need to add "source resolution" preset option

## What Doesn't Work (Known Issues)

### ❌ EPIPE Error During Refresh (PERSISTENT)
- Error occurs when refreshing Electron app
- Likely caused by child process streams (FFmpeg) writing to closed pipes
- Multiple fixes attempted but issue persists

### ⚠️ Export: Source Resolution Option Missing
- UI has 720p and 1080p presets
- No "source resolution" option available
- Need to add button/option that uses source video's resolution from metadata

### ❌ Simultaneous Screen + Webcam (PiP) Not Implemented
- UI has "both" recording type option
- No actual picture-in-picture compositing implemented
- When "both" is selected, it only records screen, not composite
- Need canvas compositing logic for PiP

### ❌ Auto-add Recordings to Timeline
- Recordings save to file system ✅
- Recordings NOT automatically added to timeline ❌
- Need to implement auto-import of recorded files into media library and timeline

## Technical Debt

### Process Management
- Need error handlers on child process streams (FFmpeg stdout/stderr)
- Need cleanup/kill child processes on renderer destroy
- EPIPE error handling needs improvement

### Console Logging
- Wrapped console methods to handle EPIPE, but issue persists
- May need to handle at child process stream level instead

## Next Priority Tasks

1. **HIGH**: Fix EPIPE error during refresh (add child process stream error handlers)
2. **MEDIUM**: Implement "source resolution" option for export
3. **MEDIUM**: Implement picture-in-picture (PiP) recording compositing
4. **MEDIUM**: Auto-add recordings to timeline after save
5. **LOW**: Implement cloud storage upload (Google Drive, Dropbox)

## Recent Git Commits

- Fix webcam recording issues (file saving, pause/resume, stop handler)
- Fix EPIPE error when refreshing Electron app (console wrapping, IPC validation)
- Fix EPIPE error by wrapping console methods (additional console method wrapping)
- Multiple timeline fixes (M/S buttons, playhead movement, clip transitions)
